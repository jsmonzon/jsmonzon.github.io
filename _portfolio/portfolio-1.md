The Stellar-Halo Mass Relation - a fundamental derivative of the galaxy-halo connection, has been investigated using a variety of different modeling techniques. 
From hydrodynamical simulations to ambundace matching techniques, there is an excellent correspondance between models over 5 orders of magnitude in halo mass. 
Until recently, there has simply been no statistically significant redshift surveys like SDSS for faint galaxies in the "classical dwarf" regime. 
This leaves the SHMR not well constrained for halo masses less massive than that of the MW. 
Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) is an imporant first step in having statistically robust galaxy samples at this low mass end.
My work focuses on what we can learn about the SHMR using these new observations. 
Specificaly we are developing a semi-anayltic forward model to learn about how natural variance in the accretion histories of halos impact our ability to learn about the SHMR.
