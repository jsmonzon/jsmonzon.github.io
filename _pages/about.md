I am a 4th year Astronomy Ph.D Candidate at [Yale University](https://astronomy.yale.edu/), advised by [Frank vandenBosch](https://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/). 

I work primarily on the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos. I am particularly interested in how low-mass/faint galaxy systems can be used to constrain cosmology. I am passionate about data science and am excited by the prospect of learning to use new programming tools (though nowadays the majority of my time is spent starring at triangle plots). I am a big advocate of DEI in the field of astronomy and am an active member of several related organizations and intiatives. 

 I grew up in Sacramento, California and am the youngest of three brothers. I recieved my B.S. from UC Santa Cruz (go slugs!) and did two years of post-grad research at NASA Ames.
Outside of academia, I enjoy bouldering, disc golfing, and playing soccer.
