## Astronomy Research Preparation Seminar (Astro-RPS)
### Yale University, 2024

I co-designed a new seminar; Astro-RPS at Yale as an introduction to the python programming language in the context of physics and astrophysics applications. I co-taught the seminar with [Imad Pasha](https://imad-pasha.github.io/), [Yasmeen Asali](https://www.yasmeenasali.com/) and Will Cerny. Because all research nowadays requires the use of extensive programming, in this seminar, we start from square one to build a strong foundation. We cover how to install and navigate the programming ecosystem such as the terminal/shell, before moving into how to create scientific programs in python to carry out calculations one might use in a research project. This seminar was primarily intended for students with little to no exposure to coding or astronomy research. 
 
 Our goal is to better prepare students for programming-based courses as well as summer research positions. This year was the first year we taught the seminar and we are happy to report that several RPS students are currenlty working on research over the summer!

## Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
### Yale University, 2021 - present

Teaching has been a big part of my career in astronomy. I started tutoring as an undergraduate for UC Santa Cruz's [Academic Excellence Program](https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/) (ACE). ACE advances educational equity in STEM by engaging students in active learning, peer mentoring, skill-building, and community development. Now as a graduate student, I am passionate about creating learning environments that are specifically designed to help students engage with the material. I find the best way to learn something is to try and explain it to someone else.

Most recently, I had the pleasure of TAing for ASTR 330. The course is a higher-level Python computing course specific to astrophysics research. It's meant to provide students with practice building software for the analysis, manipulation, reduction, and visualization of astronomical data. See the [course website](https://astro-330.github.io/intro.html) for more information. Given that coding is such an important part of my day-to-day life, I am very interested in developing useful material for up-and-coming astronomers.

I have also been a teaching assistant for a handful of lower-division astronomy/physics courses at Yale
(ASTR 110, ASTR 160, ASTR 170, and ASTR 180).
