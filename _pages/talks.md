*``DEI issues in STEM are often subtle and only stand out to minority groups. I strive to encourage diversity by dispelling imposter syndrome in all aspiring scientists. My success as a Latino student in STEM is intimately tied with my ability to carve out a path for those who are also racially and culturally underrepresented."*

## AAS Committee for the Status of Minority Students in Astronomy (CSMA)
### American Astronomical Society, 2024

I am very proud to be one of the newest graduate student members of the [CSMA's](https://aas.org/comms/csma). The CSMA's mission is to enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in astronomy at all levels. Having benefited immensely from STEM diversity programs at UC Santa Cruz, this mission resonates deeply with me. I am thrilled to engage in advocacy on this larger scale and look forward to learning from my fellow committee members.

## Astronomy Graduate Congress (AGC)
### 2023 - present

The Astronomy Graduate Student Congress [(AGC)](https://astro-grad-congress.github.io/about/)  was founded by a small group of astronomy graduates who attended the 2023 dotAstro conference in NYC. Noticing that positive changes in graduate programs often come from external pressure, we created a common platform to gain a broader perspective on graduate education issues. Our goal is to unite astronomy graduate students across the U.S. to foster interdepartmental discourse and share best practices. By discussing relevant topics and collaborating, we aim to expedite positive changes and facilitate new policy implementation. Additionally, we hope the AGC will serve as a communication channel with professional societies like the AAS, easing the burden on early career scientists.

## Astronomy Climate and Diversity Committee (ACDC)
### Yale University, 2021 - present

Since starting at Yale, I have been involved with my departments DEI intiative: [ACDC](https://campuspress.yale.edu/acdc/). The commeittee acts as both an advisory and executive board, creating proposals and recommendations for expanded programming, structural changes, etc. Our most recent project was a python seminar for first year undergraduates. You can read about [astro-RPS](https://astro-rps.github.io/) in the [Teaching and Learning](teaching.md) tab.

## YSACNAS
### Yale University, 2021 - present

I am proudly part of Yale's SACNAS chapter, having represented my graduate curriculum at two of the annual SACNAS NDiSTEM conferences (2022, 2023). I was nominated as chair of the professional development committee for Yale SACNAS and am working hard to develop programs that give underrepresented Yale students a chance to network and learn from one another. We recently held our first ever Spanish Public Night at Leitner Planetarium and Observatory! It was a big success and gave me the rare opportunity to talk about astronomy in my native tongue.

## Flipped Science Fair
### Yale University, 2023

Yale Openlabs is a graduate student organization aimed at outreach to the local New Haven community. In 2023 I participated in a Flipped Science Fair Event for middle school students interested in STEM!

Arguably the best poster at the event...
