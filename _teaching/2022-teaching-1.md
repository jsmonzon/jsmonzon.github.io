I have extensive experience in teaching astronomy, starting with my time as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz's ACE program now as a TA for astronomy courses at Yale. My passion lies in creating engaging learning environments and developing practical coding materials for future astronomers.

Teaching has been a big part of my career in astronomy. I started tutoring as an undergraduate for UC Santa Cruz's [Academic Excellence Program](https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/) (ACE). ACE advances educational equity in STEM by engaging students in active learning, peer mentoring, skill-building, and community development. Now as a graduate student, I am passionate about creating learning environments that are specifically designed to help students engage with the material. I find the best way to learn something is to try and explain it to someone else.

Most recently, I had the pleasure of TAing for ASTR 330. The course is a higher-level Python computing course specific to astrophysics research. It's meant to provide students with practice building software for the analysis, manipulation, reduction, and visualization of astronomical data. See the course [website](https://astro-330.github.io/intro.html) for more information. Given that coding is such an important part of my day-to-day life, I am very interested in developing useful material for up-and-coming astronomers.

I have also been a teaching assistant for a handful of lower-division astronomy/physics courses at Yale (ASTR 110, ASTR 160, ASTR 170, and ASTR 180).
